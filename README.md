A primitive HyperCard clone, sort of.

## Modes

Right-click to change modes.

* explore (white border)
* buttons (blue border)
* drawing (red border)

Buttons are invisible unless you're in "buttons" mode. Double-click a
button to give it a target card name for when it's clicked in explore mode.

Drawing is only straight lines for now.

Card Zero is where you start; it's a card that gets prepopulated with
a self-hosted card listing/editing interface. If you get lost at any
point, control-0 will return you to card zero.

Control-s saves, and control-l loads.

Control-c clears background, control-b clears buttons.
