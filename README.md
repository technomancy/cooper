# Cooper

<img src="http://p.hagelb.org/cooper.jpg" />

A primitive [HyperCard](http://www.loper-os.org/?p=568) clone, sort of.

## Modes

Right-click to change modes.

* explore (hand)
* buttons (crosshair)
* drawing (bullseye)

Buttons are invisible unless you're in "buttons" mode. Double-click a
button to give it a target card name for when it's clicked in explore mode.

Drawing is only straight lines for now.

Card Zero is where you start; it's a card that gets prepopulated with
a self-hosted card listing/editing interface. If you get lost at any
point, control-0 will return you to card zero.

Control-s saves, and control-l loads.

Control-c clears background, control-b clears buttons, control-n creates cards.
